- Install using pip:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   pip install .

Basic Usage
===========

Calculating Receiver Functions
------------------------------

The basic class of ``RfPy`` is :class:`~rfpy.rfdata.RFData`, which contains attributes and 
methods for the calculation of single-station, teleseismic 
`P`-wave receiver functions from three-component seismograms. A :class:`~rfpy.rfdata.RFData`
object contains three main attributes: a :class:`~stdb.StDb` object with station information,
a :class:`~rfpy.rfdata.Meta` object containing event meta data, and a :class:`~obspy.core.Stream`
object containing the unrotated 3-component seismograms. Additional processing attributes 
are added as the analysis proceeds. The sequence of initialization and addition of attributes 
is important, as described in the documentation below. 

Note that, at the end of the process, the :class:`~rfpy.rfdata.RFData` object will further contain
a :class:`~obspy.core.Stream` object as an additional attribute, containing the receiver function data.

.. note::

    A :class:`~rfpy.rfdata.RFData` object is meant to facilitate processing of single-station 
    and single-event P-wave receiver functions. For processing multiple event-station pairs, 
    an equal number of :class:`~rfpy.rfdata.RFData` objects need to be 
    created. See the accompanying Scripts for details.

Initialization
++++++++++++++

A ``RFData`` object is initialized with an :class:`~stdb.StDb` object, e.g. consider such an 
object ``sta``:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> from rfpy import RFData
    >>> rfdata = RFData(sta)


Once the object is initialized, the first step is to add an :class:`obspy.core.event.Event``
object. For example, given such an object ``ev``:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> rfdata.add_event(ev)

Now that the event has been added, the :class:`~rfpy.rfdata.RFData` object has determined
whether or not it is suitable for receiver function analysis (i.e., 
if the event is within a suitable epicentral distance range), which is
available as a new ``meta`` attribute:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> rfdata.meta.accept
    True

.. note::

    Alternatively, the :func:`~rfpy.rfdata.RFData.add_event` 
    (or :func:`~rfpy.rfdata.RFData.add_data`) method can be used
    with the argument ``returned=True`` to return the ``accept`` attribute
    directly.

    .. sourcecode:: python

        >>> rfdata.add_event(ev, returned=True)
        True

If the ``accept`` attribute is ``True``, continue with the analysis by
adding raw three-component data. There are two methods to perform this step.
If the data are available in memory (e.g., in a :class:`~obspy.core.Stream` object ``stream``), 
one can use the :func:`~rfpy.rfdata.RFData.add_data` method directly:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> rfdata.add_data(stream)

.. warning::

    **Do not** simply add a :class:`~obspy.core.Stream` object as an 
    attribute ``data`` to the :class:`~rfpy.rfdata.RFData`
    object (e.g., ``rfdata.data = stream``). Instead use this method, as it checks 
    whether or not the data are suitable for receiver function analysis.

Otherwise, one can use the method :func:`~rfpy.rfdata.RFData.download_data` to obtain 
the three-component data from an FDSN Client: 

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> rfdata.download_data(client)

The ``accept`` attribute will be updated with the availability of the ``data``
attribute, i.e. if no data is available, the ``accept`` attribute will be set
to ``False``. The methods to add data can also be used with the argument 
``returned=True`` to report whether or not the data are available. 

Receiver function processing
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now that we have complete meta data and raw seismogram data, we can
use methods to rotate and/or calculate the signal-to-noise ratio. 
The rotation flag is set in the ``rfdata.meta.align`` attribute, which by
default is ``'ZRT'``. This means that ``'ZNE'`` data will be rotated to ``'ZRT'`` 
before deconvolution, automatically. However, we can set a different alignment
(e.g., ``'LQT'`` or ``'PVH'``) and perform the rotation prior to deconvolution.
Once rotation is performed, however, the initial ``'ZNE'`` data is no longer 
available and further rotation cannot be performed:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> rfdata.rotate()        
    >>> rfdata.meta.rotated
    True
    >>> rfdata.meta.align
    'ZRT'
    >>> rfdata.rotate(align='PVH')
    ...
    Exception: Data have been rotated already - aborting

The SNR is calculated based on the ``align`` attribute, on the first component
(e.g., either ``'Z'``, ``'L'`` or ``'P'``). Therefore, this method is typically
carried out following the ``rotate`` method:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> rfdata.calc_snr()
    >>> type(rfdata.meta.snr)
    float

Finally, the last step is to perform the deconvolution using the method 
:func:`~rfpy.rfdata.RFData.deconvolve`,
which stores the receiver function data as a new attribute ``rf``, which is a 
three-component :class:`~obspy.core.Stream` object:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> rfdata.deconvolve()

Although no plotting method is provided for the :class:`~rfpy.rfdata.RFData` object, 
the ``rf`` attribute is a :class:`~obspy.core.Stream`
object that can be plotted using the :func:`~rfpy.rfdata.RFData.plot` method 
(e.g., ``rfdata.rf.plot()``).

Following receiver function deconvolution, all the information is stored in the attributes 
of the object. Ultimately, a method is available to convert the ``RFData`` object to a
:class:`~obspy.core.Stream` object with new attributes:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> rfstream = rfdata.to_stream()

Demo example
++++++++++++

To look at a concrete example for station `MMPY <http://ds.iris.edu/mda/NY/MMPY/>`_, 
consider the demo data provided with the package and process them using all default values: 

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> from rfpy import RFData
    >>> rfdata = RFData('demo')
    Uploading demo station data - station NY.MMPY

Check out its attributes (initialization only stores the ``sta`` attribute)

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> rfdata.__dict__
    {'sta': {'station': 'MMPY',
      'network': 'NY',
      'altnet': [],
      'channel': 'HH',
      'location': ['--'],
      'latitude': 62.618919,
      'longitude': -131.262466,
      'elevation': 0.0,

      'polarity': 1.0,
      'azcorr': 0.0,
      'status': 'open'},
     'meta': None,
     'data': None}

Now import an event:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> rfdata.add_event('demo')
    2014-06-30T19:55:33.710000Z | +28.391, +138.873 | 6.2 MW

Print the content of the object meta data

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> rfdata.meta.__dict__

     'lon': 138.8727,
     'lat': 28.3906,
     'dep': 527.4,
     'mag': 6.2,
     'epi_dist': 7236.909875705126,
     'az': 30.556903955991746,
     'baz': 283.91831389584587,
     'gac': 65.08309411308255,
     'ttime': 588.38610458337996,
     'slow': 0.056707554238157355,
     'inc': 19.167277207756957,
     'phase': 'P',
     'accept': True,
     'vp': 6.0,
     'vs': 3.5,
     'align': 'ZRT',
     'rotated': False,
     'snr': None,
     'snrh': None,
     'cc': None}

.. note::

    Once the event object is loaded, it is possible to edit the attributes
    of ``meta``, although we recommend only editing ``vp``, ``vs`` or 
    ``align``, and avoid editing any of the station-event attributes

    .. sourcecode:: python

        >>> rfdata.meta.vp = 5.5
        >>> rfdata.meta.vs = 3.3
        >>> rfdata.meta.vp, rfdata.meta.vs
        (5.5, 3.3)
        >>> rfdata.meta.align = 'LQT'
        >>> rfdata.meta.align
        'LQT'

Now add data to the object:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> rfdata.add_data('demo')

Post-Processing: `H-k` stacking
-------------------------------

The class :class:`~rfpy.hk.HkStack` contains attributes and methods to calculate thickness (`H`) 
and Vp/Vs ratio (`k`) of the crust (in reality, `H` refers to Moho depth, and `k` is Vp/Vs of 
the medium from the surface to `H`) based on moveout times of direct `Ps` and reverberated 
`Pps` and `Pss` phases from radial-component receiver functions. The individual 
phase stacks are obtained from the median weighted by the phase of individual 
signals. Methods are available to combine the phase stacks into a weighted sum
or a product. 

Initialization
++++++++++++++

A ``HkStack`` object is initialized with a :class:`~obspy.core.Stream` 
object containing radial receiver function data. The :class:`~obspy.core.Stream` 
is built by adding (or appending) radial receiver functions obtained from valid
:class:`~rfpy.rfdata.RFData` objects using the :func:`~rfpy.rfdata.RFData.to_stream`
method.

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> from rfpy import HkStack
    >>> hkstack = HkStack(rfstream)

The ``rfstream`` typically requires minimal pre-processing, such as
bandpass filtering to enhance the converted and reverberated phases.
For example:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> rfstream.filter('bandpass', freqmin=0.05, freqmax=0.75, corners=2, zerophase=True)
    >>> hkstack = HkStack(rfstream)

.. note::

    It is also possible to use two ``rfstream`` objects during initialization
    of the :class:`~rfpy.hk.HkStack` object - one for the direct conversion 
    (i.e., ``'ps'`` phase), 
    and the second one for the reverberated phases (i.e., ``'pps'``, ``'pss'``).
    The second ``rfstream`` should therefore be a copy of the first one, but perhaps
    filtered uding different frequency corners:

    .. sourcecode:: python

        >>> rfstream2 = rfstream.copy()
        >>> rfstream2.filter('bandpass', freqmin=0.05, freqmax=0.35, corners=2, zerophase=True)
        >>> hkstack = HkStack(rfstream, rfstream2)

To speed things up during processing (and to avoid redundant stacking), it is possible to
use one of the :func:`~rfpy.binning` functions, alghouth **not** the 
:func:`~rfpy.binning.bin_all` function, e.g.,

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> from rfpy.binning import bin
    >>> rfstream_binned = rfstream.bin(typ='slow', nbin=21)
    >>> hkstack = HkStack(rfstream_binned)

H-k processing
++++++++++++++

Once the :class:`~rfpy.hk.HkStack` object is initialized with the ``rfstream``, a findividual phase
stacks can be calculated automatically using the default settings:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> hkstack.stack()

The only parameter to set is the `P`-wave velocity of the crust - if not set,
the default value of 6.0 km/s is used (available as the attribute ``hkstack.vp``).
To change the search bounds for the phase stacks, we can edit the attributes of the
:class:`~rfpy.hk.HkStack` object prior to calling the method :func:`~rfpy.hk.HkStack.stack`:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> hkstack.hbound = [15., 40.]
    >>> hkstack.dh = 1.5
    >>> hkstack.kbound = [1.6, 2.0]
    >>> hkstack.dk = 0.01
    >>> hkstack.stack(vp=5.5)

.. warning::

    Setting small values for ``hkstack.dh`` and ``hkstack.dk`` will slow down
    the processing significantly, but produce much cleaner and more precise
    stacks.

In the presence of a dipping Moho interface, it is possible to use the method
:func:`~rfpy.hk.HkStack.stack_dip`, with the additional ``strike`` and ``dip`` arguments.
If not specified, the code will use the default values stored as attributes of the
:class:`~rfpy.hk.HkStack` object:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> hkstack.stack_dip(strike=215., dip=25., vp=5.5)

Once the phase stacks are calculated and stored as attributes of the object,
we can call the method :func:`~rfpy.hk.HkStack.average` to combine the phase stacks
into a single, final stack. By default the final stack is a simple weighted sum 
of the individual phase stacks, using weights defined as object attributes:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> hkstack.weights
    [0.5, 2., -1.]
    >>> hkstack.average()

To produce a final stack that consists of the product of the positive parts
of individual phase stacks (to enhance normal-polarity Moho arrivals and ignore
un-modelled negative polarity signals), use the ``typ='product'`` argument:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> hkstack.average(typ='product')

The estimates of `H` and `k` are determined from the maximum value in the final
stack as attributes ``hkstack.h0`` and ``hkstack.k0``. The method will also 
call the :func:`~rfpy.hk.HkStack.error` method to calculate the errors
and error contour around the solution.

The individual and final stacks can be plotted by calling the method 
:func:`~rfpy.hk.HkStack.plot`:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> hkstack.plot()


Demo example
++++++++++++

Initialize object with demo data for station `MMPY <http://ds.iris.edu/mda/NY/MMPY/>`_:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> from rfpy import HkStack
    >>> hkstack = HkStack('demo')
    Uploading demo data - station NY.MMPY

    >>> # Check content of object
    >>> hkstack.__dict__
    {'rfV1': 198 Trace(s) in Stream:

    ...
    (196 other traces)
    ...

     'strike': None,
     'dip': None,
     'vp': 6.0,
     'kbound': [1.56, 2.1],
     'dk': 0.02,
     'hbound': [20.0, 50.0],
     'dh': 0.5,
     'weights': [0.5, 2.0, -1.0],
     'phases': ['ps', 'pps', 'pss']}

These receiver functions have been obtained by adding :class:`~rfpy.rfdata.RFData` objects
as streams to an :class:`~obspy.core.Stream` object, without other processing. Note that they
are aligned in the ``'PVH'`` coordinate system, as specified in the channel name (i.e., ``'RFV'`` for
the radial component). To prepare them for stacking, we can bin the receiver functions into
back-azimuth and slowness bins (in the presence of a dipping interface), or simply slowness bins 
(for horizontal interfaces):

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> from rfpy import binning
    >>> rfV_binned = binning.bin(hkstack.rfV1, typ='slow', nbin=21)[0]
    >>> hkstack.rfV1 = rfV_binned

it is straightforward to directly
filter the :class:`~obspy.core.Stream` object, and perhaps also add a copy of the stream
with a different frequency corner as another attribute ``rfV2``, as suggested above:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> hkstack.rfV2 =  hkstack.rfV1.copy()
    >>> hkstack.rfV1.filter('bandpass', freqmin=0.05, freqmax=0.5, corners=2, zerophase=True)
    >>> hkstack.rfV2.filter('bandpass', freqmin=0.05, freqmax=0.35, corners=2, zerophase=True)

Now simply process the hkstack object using the default values to obtain `H` and `k` estimates

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> hkstack.stack()
    Computing: [###############] 61/61

    >>> hkstack.average()

The final estimates are available as attributes

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> hkstack.h0
    34.0
    >>> hkstack.err_h0
    3.5
    >>> hkstack.k0
    1.74
    >>> hkstack.err_k0
    0.13

Plot the stacks with error contours

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> hkstack.plot()

.. figure:: ../rfpy/examples/data/Figure_hk_demo.png

Post-Processing: Harmonic Decomposition
---------------------------------------

The class :class:`~rfpy.harmonics.Harmonics` contains attributes and methods to 
calculate the first five 
harmonic components of radial and transverse component receiver function
data from a singular value decomposition. The harmonic decomposition can 
be performed at a fixed azimuth (i.e., along some known dominant strike 
direction in the subsurface), or alternatively the decomposition can 
be optimized to search for the dominant azimuth that maximizes the energy
on one of the components. This direction can be interpreted as the 
strike of a dipping interface or can be related to anisotropic axes.

Initialization
++++++++++++++

a :class:`~rfpy.harmonics.Harmonics` object is initialized with **both** radial
and transverse component receiver function :class:`~obspy.core.Stream` objects.
The :class:`~obspy.core.Stream` objects are built by adding (or appending) 
radial and transverse receiver functions obtained from valid
:class:`~rfpy.rfdata.RFData` objects using the :func:`~rfpy.rfdata.RFData.to_stream`
method.

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> from rfpy import Harmonics
    >>> harmonics = Harmonics(rfRstream, rfTstream)

.. note::

    The ``rfRstream`` and ``rfTstream`` typically require minimal pre-processing, such as
    bandpass filtering to enhance the converted and reverberated phases.
    For example:

    .. sourcecode:: python

        >>> rfRstream.filter('bandpass', freqmin=0.05, freqmax=0.75, corners=2, zerophase=True)
        >>> rfTstream.filter('bandpass', freqmin=0.05, freqmax=0.75, corners=2, zerophase=True)
        >>> harmonics = Harmonics(rfRstream, rfTstream)

.. warning::

    The radial and transverse components should not be mixed, and should contain 
    purely radial and purely transverse components (i.e. no mixing of components). 
    Furthermore, the :class:`~obspy.core.Stream` objects should have equal length
    and the same ordering.

Harmonic decomposition
++++++++++++++++++++++

Once the :class:`~rfpy.harmonics.Harmonics` object is initialized, processing is done by typing:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> harmonics.dcomp_fix_azim() 

Or, alternatively,

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> harmonics.dcomp_find_azim()

To use `numba` compiler to increase speed,

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> harmonics.dcomp_find_azim(use_numba=True)

In either case the harmonic components are available as an attribute of type
:class:`~obspy.core.Stream` (``harmonics.hstream``) and, if available, the azimuth
of the dominant direction (``harmonics.azim``). 

.. note::

    When using the method :func:`rfpy.harmonics.dcomp_find_azim`, it is possible to
    specify a range of values over which to perform the search using the arguments
    ``xmin`` and ``xmax``, where `x` refers to the independent variable (i.e., time
    or depth, if the streams have been converted from time to depth a priori). 

Once the harmonic decomposition is performed, the components can be plotted using
the method :func:`~rfpy.harmonics.Harmonics.plot`

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> harmonics.plot()

Forward modeling
++++++++++++++++

If the ``hstream`` attribute is available, it is possible to *forward model* receiver functions
for a range of back-azimuth values, or just a single value. In case the back-azimuths are
not specified, the method will use the range of values available in the original
radial and transverse component receiver function data.

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> harmonics.forward()

The new `predicted` radial and transverse component receiver functions are available
as attributes of type :class:`~obspy.core.Stream` (``harmonics.forwardR`` and ``harmonics.forwardT``)

Demo example
++++++++++++

Initialize object with demo data for station `MMPY <http://ds.iris.edu/mda/NY/MMPY/>`_:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> from rfpy import Harmonics
    >>> harmonics = Harmonics('demo')
    Uploading demo data - station NY.MMPY

    >>> # Check content of object
    >>> harmonics.__dict__
    {'radialRF': 198 Trace(s) in Stream:

As with the :class:`~rfpy.hk.HkStack` object, these receiver functions have been obtained 
by adding :class:`~rfpy.rfdata.RFData` objects
as streams to an :class:`~obspy.core.Stream` object, without other processing. Note that they
are aligned in the ``'PVH'`` coordinate system, as specified in the channel name (i.e., ``'RFV'`` 
and ``'RFH'``). To prepare them for harmonic decomposition, we can bin the receiver functions into
back-azimuth and slowness bins :

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> from rfpy import binning
    >>> str_binned = binning.bin_baz_slow(harmonics.radialRF, harmonics.transvRF)
    >>> harmonics.radialRF = str_binned[0]
    >>> harmonics.transvRF = str_binned[1]

It is straightforward to directly
filter the :class:`~obspy.core.Stream` object, and perhaps also add a copy of the stream
with a different frequency corner as another attribute ``rfV2``, as suggested above:

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> harmonics.radialRF.filter('bandpass', freqmin=0.05, freqmax=0.5, corners=2, zerophase=True)
    >>> harmonics.transvRF.filter('bandpass', freqmin=0.05, freqmax=0.5, corners=2, zerophase=True)

Now simply perform harmonic decomposition

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> harmonics.dcomp_fix_azim()
    Decomposing receiver functions into baz harmonics for azimuth =  0

Plot them

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> harmonics.plot(ymax=10.)
