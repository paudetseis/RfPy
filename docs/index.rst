=============

``RfPy`` is a package containing Python tools for calculating teleseismic
receiver functions. Methods are available to plot and post-process 
receiver function data. Post processing includes: H-k method,
Harmonic decomposition and CCP stacking. The code uses 
the ``StDb`` package for querying and building a station database 
used in command-line scripts.
